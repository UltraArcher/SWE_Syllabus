## Programming fundamentals

### Software development

#### Explore fundamental software development steps used by programmers when designing software

Including:
- requirements definition
- determining specifications
- design
- development
- integration
- testing and debugging
- installation
- maintainance

#### Research and evaluate the prevalence and use of online code collaboration tools

### Designing algorithms

#### Apply computational thinking and algorithmic design by defining the key features of standard algorithms, including sequence, selection, iteration and identifying data that should be stored

#### Apply divide and conquer and backtracking as algorithmic design strategies

#### Develop structured algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts, including the use of subprograms

#### Use modelling tools including structure charts, abstraction and refinement diagrams to support top-down and bottom-up design

#### Analyse the logic and structure of written algorithms

Including:
- determining inputs and outputs
- determining the purpose of the algorithm
- desk checking and peer checking
- determining connections of written algorithms to other subroutines or functions

#### Identify procedures and functions in an algorithm

#### Experiment with object-oriented programming, imperative, logic and functional programming paradigms

### Data for software engineering

#### Investigate the use of number systems for computing purposes, including binary, decimal and hexadecimal

#### Represent integers using two's compliment

#### Investigate standard data types

Including:
- char (character) and string
- Boolean
- real
- single precision floating point
- integer
- date and time

#### Create data dictionaries as a tool to describe data and data types, structure data, and record arrays

#### Use data structures of arrays, records, trees and sequential files

### Developing solutions with code

#### Apply skills in computational thinking and programming to develop a software solution

Including:
- converting an algorithm into code
- using control structures
- using data structures
- using standard modules
- creating relevant subprograms that incorporate parameter passing

#### Impliment data structures that support data storage

Including:
- single and multidimensional arrays
- lists
- trees
- stacks
- hash tables

#### Compare the execution of the Waterfall and Agile project management models as applied to software development

#### Test and evaluate solutions, condsidering key aspects including functionality, performance, readability of code, quality of documentation

#### Use debugging tools

Including:
- breakpoints
- single line stepping
- watches
- interfaces between functions
- debugging output statements
- debugging software available in an integrated development environment (IDE)

#### Determine sets of suitable test data

Including:
- boundary values
- path coverage
- faulty and abnormal data

#### Determine typical errors experienced when developing code, including syntax, logic and runtime, and explain their likely causes.
